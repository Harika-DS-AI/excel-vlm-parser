# Excel VLM Parser

This project uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to extract structured tables from Excel screenshots.

## Features
- Extract data from Excel screenshots using Donut VLM
- Convert output into structured JSON
- Future work: train agent with Reinforcement Learning to improve extraction

## Folder Structure
- `images/` - input Excel screenshots
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for prototyping
- `scripts/` - standalone Python scripts
- `requirements.txt` - dependencies

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies
3. Run the example notebook in `notebooks/`

Stay tuned for Phase 2!
